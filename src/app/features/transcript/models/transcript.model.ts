/**
 * SHARED LOGIC — mirrored in
 * `Acheva-WEB-UI/src/app/@features/transcript/models/transcript.model.ts`.
 *
 * The two portals share no package, so this is a deliberate copy. A student's
 * transcript and the copy their Course Advisor prints must be the SAME
 * document; if these two files drift, two people holding what they believe is
 * one record are holding two. Change one, change the other.
 *
 * The two copies are NOT byte-identical and cannot be: the repos run Prettier
 * at different print widths, so each is formatted to its own house style. Only
 * the formatting may differ — every value, string and rule here must match.

/**
 * The transcript payload, mirroring `ITranscript` in the backend
 * (`acheva-nestjs/src/transcript/transcript.types.ts`).
 *
 * Kept in step by hand, the same way `result-sheet.model.ts` mirrors
 * `result-sheet.types.ts` — the two repos share no package. Change one, change
 * the other.
 *
 * Every figure here is COMPUTED SERVER-SIDE. Nothing in this app recalculates
 * a GPA or a grade point: the whole value of a transcript is that the figures
 * on the paper are the figures of record, and a second implementation of the
 * arithmetic is a second chance to disagree with them.
