/**
 * Day labels for a conversation, the way WhatsApp does them.
 *
 * A bare clock time is ambiguous the moment a thread is older than a day:
 * "8:36 PM" on its own cannot tell you whether a Head answered last night or
 * last month, which matters when a message is the record of when somebody was
 * told something. So the conversation carries a day separator above the first
 * message of each day, and the thread list shows a day instead of a time once
 * the last message is no longer from today.
 *
 * Everything here works in the READER'S LOCAL TIME. A message sent at 00:30
 * belongs to the day the reader would call it, not to whatever UTC says — and
 * comparing ISO strings or UTC dates gets that wrong for exactly the people
 * most likely to be messaging late at night.
