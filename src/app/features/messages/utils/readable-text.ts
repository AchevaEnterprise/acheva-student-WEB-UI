/**
 * The last line of defence between stored ciphertext and a reader's screen.
 *
 * Message bodies are encrypted at rest and decrypted by the API, so in a
 * correctly deployed system nothing here ever fires. It exists because the
 * failure it guards against actually happened (2026-09-24): an API running
 * code from before encryption was added served envelopes straight through, and
 * a Head of Department saw `enc.v1.bWI-CggGEx4kYrVI…` where a message should
 * have been.
 *
 * A stale deploy, a rolled-back release, a key removed from the environment —
 * any of them can put an envelope on the wire. None of them is the reader's
 * problem, and none of them should be shown to the reader as if it were
 * content. So every surface that prints a message body or a preview runs it
 * through here first.
 *
 * This is a safety net, NOT a fix: if it ever fires, the API is wrong and the
 * server logs will say so.
