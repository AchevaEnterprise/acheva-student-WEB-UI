 * Mirrors the backend messaging contract (`acheva-nestjs/src/messaging/`), and

 * repos share no package — the same hand-kept arrangement the result-sheet and
 * transcript models already use. If you change one, change the other.
 *
 * A student's side of messaging is narrower than a lecturer's: they can write
 * to exactly one person (their Course Advisor), they read announcements they
 * cannot reply to, and they have one thread with the Acheva support desk.
 * Nothing here enforces that — the server does — but it is why the student
 * portal has no announcement composer and no people picker.
